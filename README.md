# AWS ECS Deployment Scripts

Deployment scripts for AWS ECS

## Installation

```bash
cd myproject
git clone https://github.com/TheLarsonAgency/aws-ecs-deploy-scripts.git
cd $_
cp env.sh{.example,}
```

The env.sh may exist in any directory.  **Don't ever add or commit it!**

Edit the `env.sh` script to match your settings, then `source env.sh`.

From here on, in that terminal, you may execute the scripts to deploy your application.
